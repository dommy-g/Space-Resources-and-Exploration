tAMing particle is capturing an opportunity to apply for DoraHacks Space Resources and Exploration Grant.
The grant opens up an opportunity to develop the project outfitting Mars habitat further. 

And although some of the aspects of the initial project might seem surrealistic just now, they are definitely the initial steps towards the interplanetary future. 
Some of the technologies that were developed during the initial project at NASA Space Apps, where the team won Best Use of Technology award, can be applied on Earth already today.
The team is now seeking to further develop the project shifting focus towards additive manufacturing techniques which would be viable on other planets and natural satellites such as Mars and Moon. 
In addition, the team would like to develop topology optimisation algorithms in Rhino Grasshopper further. 
Thus the Grant would allow to continue work on topology optimization algorithms using Rhino Grasshopper and search for additive manufacturing 
techniques which can be used on Earth and other planets or natural satellites such as Moon.
